# Nand2Tetris
This repository aims to build a modern computer system inspired by Nand2Tetris.
## Projects Description
1. Project 1 builds a series of fundamental logic gates with only given Nand gate by using Hardware Description Language (HDL).
2. Project 2 builds the adders to add numbers and build an Arithematic Logic Unit (ALU).
3. Project 3 builds the main memory unit Random Access Memory (RAM) of the computer based on sequential logic.
4. Project 4 uses the Hack machine language to build two simple programs (Fill and Mult).
5. Project 5 implement the Hack Computer by assembling three components: ROM32K, CPU and Memory.
6. Project 6 implements the Assembler of Hack Computer in Python, which translates the assembly Hack Program into corresponding Hack machine code.
