# Nand2Tetris
This repository aims to build a modern computer system inspired by Nand2Tetris.
## Projects Description
1. Project 1 builds a series of fundamental logic gates with only given Nand gate by using Hardware Description Language (HDL).
2. Project 2 builds the adders to add numbers and build an Arithematic Logic Unit (ALU).
3. Project 3 builds the main memory unit Random Access Memory (RAM) of the computer based on sequential logic.
